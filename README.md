Exploring about coherent interactions that add value to the relations between individuals and machines.

Soluna here, I like to learn and think about our experience as a specie and the behaviors we implement to interact with the environment. I am a believer that technology is being used to enhance this experience, life's experiences. Machines that are learning to operate and take decisions from a greater good perspective are the pillars of evolution and peaceful times.
